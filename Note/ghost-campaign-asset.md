GHOST: The 100 Customer Launch Kit

1. The Viral Video Script (The "Comcast Challenge")

Scene: Split screen. Left side is your face (looking nervous). Right side is the "Ghost" Dashboard recording the audio.
Audio: You are on speakerphone with a customer support agent.

(0:00 - 0:10)
You (Voiceover): "I'm terrified of confrontation, but my internet bill just went up by $40. I built an AI to negotiate for me. Let's see if it works."

(0:10 - 0:30) - The Conflict
Agent (On Phone): "I'm sorry sir, that was a promotional rate. The standard rate is $120."
You (Looking at Ghost): Ghost flashes red card: [Label: Price Anchoring. Action: Ask for 'Retention Offer']
You (Reading Screen): "I understand, but I've been a loyal customer for three years. Do you have any retention offers available before I look at competitors?"

(0:30 - 0:50) - The Climax
Agent: "Well... I can offer you a $5 one-time credit."
Ghost flashes: [Label: Lowball Detected. Action: Silence + "Is that the best you can do?"]
You (Pausing, looking nervous): "..." (Silence for 5 seconds) "Is that the absolute best you can do?"

(0:50 - 1:00) - The Win
Agent: "Okay, let me check... I can actually lock you in at $85 for another 12 months."
Ghost flashes: [Label: WIN. Action: Accept & Close]
You: "Done. Thank you."

(1:00) - Call to Action
You: "This is Ghost. It whispers what to say in real-time. I'm letting 50 people use it for their sales calls and interviews. Link in bio."

2. Reddit "Trojan Horse" Strategy

Target Subreddits: r/sales, r/ColdCall, r/socialanxiety, r/jobsearch, r/interview

Post Title: "I built a real-time AI tool to stop me from freezing up during cold calls. Roast my setup?"

Post Body:
"Hey guys, long-time lurker. I'm an SDR and I have terrible anxiety when prospects throw curveballs or technical objections. I usually freeze and lose the deal.

I’m a dev on the side, so I hacked together a tool that listens to my Zoom calls and flashes cue cards on my screen with answers. It’s saved me 3 times this week when asked about pricing vs competitors.

It’s ugly, but it works. I’m thinking of letting a few people try it out for free in exchange for feedback.

Here is a video of it in action: [Link to Video]

If you want to try it for your interviews or sales calls, drop a comment and I'll DM you the access key."

Why this works: You aren't "selling." You are a builder asking for feedback. The "Roast my setup" title invites engagement.

3. LinkedIn "Humble Brag" Strategy

Target: Sales Leaders, Recruiters, Tech Enthusiasts.

Post Text:
"Everyone talks about AI replacing jobs. I built an AI to help me GET one.

I tend to ramble in interviews. So I built 'Ghost'. It listens to the interviewer's question, checks my resume + the job description, and flashes the perfect talking points on my screen in <400ms.

It’s like having a career coach whispering in your ear.

I just used it to pass a mock technical interview at [Company Name].

I'm opening up 50 Beta spots for:

SDRs who need objection handling.

Job seekers who want to ace the interview.

First 50 get Lifetime Access for the price of a dinner. DM me 'GHOST'."

4. Cold DM Script (Discord/Twitter)

Target: People posting "I just bombed my interview" or "I hate cold calling."

Script:
"Hey [Name], saw your tweet about the interview. That sucks. I actually built a tool called Ghost specifically for that—it listens to the call and gives you the answer on-screen so you don't freeze up next time.

I'm looking for beta testers to break it. Want a free pass to try it on your next mock interview? No strings."
