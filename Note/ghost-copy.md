Ghost: The Auditory Sales Co-Pilot

Headline: Stop Losing Deals to Pricing Objections. Start Winning with Undetectable, Real-Time AI.

Sub-Headline: Ghost is the world's first auditory sales co-pilot. We put your entire objection handling playbook directly in your sales rep's ear, giving them the perfect counter-argument or strategic cue in under 500 milliseconds, without breaking eye contact or focus.

The Problem: The High Cost of the "Um" Moment

Your top reps know the playbook, but under pressure, they hesitate. When a customer drops the "Price is too high" bomb, the rep's eyes instantly dart to their notes, their screen, or they stumble on a weak, unapproved response.

Problem 1: Latency: Post-call coaching (Gong/Chorus) is too late. Waiting until after the deal is lost doesn't help.

Problem 2: Distraction: Text alerts (Dialpad) force the rep to look away and read a screen pop-up, sacrificing rapport and eye contact.

Problem 3: Inconsistency: Every time a rep ad-libs a response, you risk losing thousands in ACV.


The Ghost Solution: Intelligence Meets Stealth

Ghost solves the "moment of truth" by providing the perfect, company-approved coaching, delivered through a discreet, seamless audio prompt.

1. Undetectable & Stealthy (The Core Advantage)

Ghost operates as a sidecar desktop application. It captures the user's microphone but routes the AI's TTS response only to the user's headphones. The customer on the Zoom/Meet call never hears or sees the AI.

Result: The sales rep maintains full focus, control, and professional eye contact. It’s like having your best CRO whispering strategy into your ear.

2. Real-Time, Sub-500ms Response

We utilize a dedicated Voice-to-Voice (V2V) engine combined with Gemini 2.5 Flash to ensure the lowest possible latency. The instant the customer's voice registers a keyword (e.g., "competitor," "budget," "timeline"), Ghost responds.

Result: Your rep counters immediately, eliminating the awkward pause and regaining control of the conversation.

3. Grounded in Your Playbook (RAG-Powered)

Ghost is not generic AI. You upload your custom documents, pricing guides, and battlecards (PDFs, Markdown) into the Knowledge Base. Ghost then uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure every piece of advice is:

Approved: It will only use the exact counter-arguments and facts defined by your enablement team.

Accurate: No generic, hallucinated responses—just hard, factual data when it's needed most.

Key Features (The Ghost Difference)

Auditory Objection Handling: Receive a concise, 10-word command (e.g., "Pivot to TCO. Mention 3-year savings.") the moment an objection is voiced.

Real-Time Pacing & Tone Correction: Get nudges if you're speaking too fast, too softly, or interrupting the customer unnecessarily.

Stealth Mode: Works with Zoom, Meet, Teams, and any other platform, guaranteed to be undetectable by the customer.

Visual Transcript Backup: The AI's spoken command is simultaneously displayed in the desktop sidebar for quick visual confirmation.

Custom Knowledge Ingestion: Easily upload your proprietary guides and data to train the AI's memory.

Stop Coaching After the Fact. Start Winning in the Moment.

Ghost moves coaching from a costly post-call review session to a powerful, real-time tool that immediately boosts closing rates and improves pricing integrity.
